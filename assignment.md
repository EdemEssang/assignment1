# ASSIGNMENT:
Come up with 5 realistic projects to work relating to your current professional background and future projections.



## 1 Data pipeline development project (weather):
In this project, I want to learn  the fundamental process of building a data pipeline, focusing on three core aspects of data engineering: data collection, cleansing, and storage. 
Using Python, to fetch weather conditions and forecasts from various locations from readily available public weather APIs. Once the weather data is collected, I will process the raw data, which may involve converting temperature units, handling missing values, or standardizing location names. Finally, store the cleansed data in a  database.
## 2 Real time Data processing project:
I will learn and know how to set up a system that will effectively and efficiently process data in real-time using any system of interest.

## 3 Data lake implementation project:
Data lakes store large amounts of data in their original format. They are essential for handling and analyzing big data. Will learn and know to to implement data lakes using any system of study

## 4 Data warehousing project:
Implementing a data warehouse makes data retrieval more efficient and simplifies data management, along with ensuring data quality and enabling insights into data. I will learn and know how to implement a data warehouse given any system of interest

## 5 Data Quality Monitoring System
I will learn and know how to  develop a system that monitors and reports on the quality of data within an organization, identifying issues like missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies.
